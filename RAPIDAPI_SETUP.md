## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "RAPIDAPI_KEY is required" Error
- **Problem**: The app can't find your API key
- **Solution**: 
  - Make sure you created a `.env` file
  - Check that the key is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
  - Restart the application after changing `.env`

#### "Failed to fetch properties" Error
- **Problem**: API requests are failing
- **Solutions**:
  - Double-check your API key is correct
  - Make sure your RapidAPI subscription is active
  - Check if you've exceeded the free tier limits
  - Try a different location in your search

#### No Search Results
- **Problem**: Search returns no properties
- **Solutions**:
  - Try different locations (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA", "Chicago, IL")
  - Check if the API has data for your area
  - Verify your API subscription includes the data you need

### Testing Your API Key Manually

You can test your API key using this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://realtor-data1.p.rapidapi.com/property_list/ \
  --header 'X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  --header 'X-RapidAPI-Host: realtor-data1.p.rapidapi.com' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "query": {
      "status": ["for_sale"],
      "postal_code": "10022"
    },
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Start with Free Tier**: Most APIs offer a free tier with limited requests per month
2. **Check Rate Limits**: Free tiers usually have daily/monthly limits
3. **Test Different Locations**: Some APIs have better data coverage in certain areas
4. **Keep Your Key Secure**: Never share your API key publicly
5. **Monitor Usage**: Check your RapidAPI dashboard for usage statistics

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Check RapidAPI Support**: Look for help documentation on the API page
2. **Verify Your Account**: Make sure your RapidAPI account is fully activated
3. **Try a Different API**: If one doesn't work, try another real estate API
4. **Check the Logs**: Look at your application logs for specific error messages
